			<h2 class="titulo1">Client-Server Architecture</h2>
			<div id="english">
				<p>Client-server architecture, architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service. Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines. This computing model is especially effective when clients and the server each have distinct tasks that they routinely perform.</p>	
				<p>In hospital data processing, for example, a client computer can be running an application program for entering patient information while the server computer is running another program that manages the database in which the information is permanently stored. Many clients can access the server’s information simultaneously, and, at the same time, a client computer can perform other tasks, such as sending e-mail. Because both client and server computers are considered intelligent devices, the client-server model is completely different from the old “mainframe” model, in which a centralized mainframe computer performed all the tasks for its associated “dumb” terminals.</p>	
				<h2 class="titulo1">Architecture MVC</h2>
				<p>The MVC model or "pattern" is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces. It is provides the fundamental pieces for designing a programs for desktop or mobile, as well as web applications. It works well with object-oriented programming, since the different models, views, and controllers can be treated as objects and reused within an application.</p>
				<p>Below is a description of each aspect of MVC:</p>
				<p>1. Model</p>
				<p>A model is data used by a program. This may be a database, file, or a simple object, such as an icon or a character in a video game.</p>
				<p>2. View</p>
				<p>A view is the means of displaying objects within an application. Examples include displaying a window or buttons or text within a window. It includes anything that the user can see.</p>
				<p>3. Controller</p>
				<p>A controller updates both models and views. It accepts input and performs the corresponding update. For example, a controller can update a model by changing the attributes of a character in a video game. It may modify the view by displaying the updated character in the game.</p>
				<p>The three parts of MVC are interconnected (see diagram). The view displays the model for the user. The controller accepts user input and updates the model and view accordingly. While MVC is not required in application design, many programming languages and IDEs support the MVC architecture, making it an common choice for developers.</p>
